## What's Left to Build

### Enhanced Testing
- ⬜ Update test imports for new structure
- ⬜ Add unit tests for core components
- ⬜ Implement integration tests
- ⬜ Create test coverage reporting

### CI/CD Pipeline
- ⬜ Set up GitHub Actions workflow
- ⬜ Implement automated testing
- ⬜ Configure linting and formatting checks
- ⬜ Set up automated Docker builds

### Advanced Features
- ⬜ Implement additional comparison metrics
- ✅ Add support for custom model loading
- ⬜ Create advanced visualization components
- ⬜ Implement user feedback collection
- ⬜ Implement model quantization for resource-constrained environments

### Documentation Enhancements
- ⬜ Create API documentation
- ⬜ Develop comprehensive developer guide
- ⬜ Add code examples for extension
- ⬜ Create user tutorials
- ⬜ Add model comparison examples and benchmarks

### Performance Optimizations
- ⬜ Implement model quantization options
- ⬜ Add caching for frequent requests

## Current Status

The project has been enhanced with improved model setup capabilities and documentation. The framework now supports downloading Llama 3 models and setting up the environment for LCM with clear instructions and separate scripts.

### Key Achievements
1. Created separate scripts for Llama 3 download and LCM environment setup
2. Added support for both venv and uv environment setup
3. Updated documentation with detailed model setup instructions
4. Improved Memory Bank with current project context
5. Established clear model storage structure

### Current Priorities
1. Explore options for using LCM without pre-trained models
2. Update UI components for new model capabilities
3. Implement model quantization for resource-constrained environments
4. Create detailed guides for model comparison

### Known Issues
1. Llama 3 models require Hugging Face account and license acceptance
2. Pre-trained LCM models are not available for direct download
3. Training LCM models requires significant computational resources
4. Test suite needs to be updated for new models

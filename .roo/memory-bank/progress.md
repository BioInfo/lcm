## Current Status

The project has been successfully reorganized following software engineering best practices. The core functionality is preserved, and the new structure provides a solid foundation for future development.

### Key Achievements
1. Established clear separation of concerns with modular architecture
2. Implemented proper Python package structure
3. Created flexible configuration system
4. Set up comprehensive documentation
5. Updated Docker configuration for modern deployment

### Current Priorities
1. Ensure all components work correctly with the new structure
2. Complete documentation updates
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline
4. Add enhanced testing

### Known Issues
1. Some import paths may need adjustment
2. Documentation might need updates to reflect new structure
3. Test suite needs to be updated for new organization

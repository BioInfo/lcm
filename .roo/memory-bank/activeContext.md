# LCM Framework Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on improving the model download process and documentation. This involves:

1. Setting up separate download scripts for different models
2. Supporting both traditional venv and modern uv environments
3. Providing clear documentation for model download requirements
4. Updating the Memory Bank to reflect current project state
5. Ensuring proper directory structure for downloaded models
6. Maintaining comprehensive documentation

## Recent Changes

The project has undergone significant updates:

1. **Model Download Improvements**
   - Created separate script for downloading Llama 3 from Hugging Face
   - Created script for downloading LCM-7B directly from Meta's GitHub
   - Updated directory structure for model storage
   - Added support for uv environment setup

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated README.md with detailed model download instructions
   - Added information about hardware requirements
   - Included instructions for both venv and uv environments
   - Clarified the model licensing requirements

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Added support for uv-based virtual environments
   - Maintained backward compatibility with traditional venv
   - Improved dependency installation documentation
   - Clarified hardware requirements for model inference

4. **Memory Bank Updates**
   - Updated activeContext.md to reflect current focus
   - Updated progress.md to track completed work
   - Ensured documentation consistency across the project

## Active Decisions

1. **Model Selection**
   - Decision to use Llama 3 8B instead of Llama 2 7B
   - Rationale: Provides more recent model architecture for comparison

2. **LCM Download Approach**
   - Decision to download LCM directly from Meta's GitHub repository
   - Rationale: Ensures access to official model weights and implementation

3. **Environment Management**
   - Decision to support both venv and uv for environment setup
   - Rationale: Provides flexibility while encouraging modern, faster tools

4. **Model Storage Structure**
   - Decision to store models in separate directories (llama-3-8b and lcm)
   - Rationale: Maintains clear separation between different model architectures

## Next Steps

1. **Model Integration**
   - Integrate downloaded models with the comparison framework
   - Update inference code to work with Llama 3 and LCM-7B

2. **UI Updates**
   - Update UI components to reflect new model capabilities
   - Add model-specific visualizations and metrics

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement model quantization for resource-constrained environments
   - Add caching mechanisms for improved inference speed

4. **Documentation Expansion**
   - Create detailed guides for model comparison
   - Add examples of model strengths and weaknesses
   - Document hardware optimization strategies

## Current Challenges

1. **Model Access Requirements**
   - Llama 3 requires Hugging Face account and license acceptance
   - Solution: Clear documentation and authentication guidance

2. **Hardware Requirements**
   - LCM-7B and Llama 3 8B require significant GPU memory
   - Solution: Document requirements and provide CPU fallback options

3. **GitHub Repository Dependencies**
   - LCM download depends on Meta's GitHub repositories
   - Solution: Robust error handling and clear troubleshooting guides

4. **Environment Compatibility**
   - Supporting both traditional and modern Python environments
   - Solution: Comprehensive documentation for multiple setup approaches

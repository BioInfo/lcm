# LCM Framework Active Context

## Current Focus

The current focus is on reorganizing the project structure to follow software engineering best practices. This involves:

1. Establishing a clear directory structure
2. Implementing proper module organization
3. Setting up configuration management
4. Creating standardized entry points
5. Updating Docker configuration
6. Ensuring comprehensive documentation

## Recent Changes

The project has undergone significant restructuring:

1. **Directory Reorganization**
   - Created modular `src` directory with subdirectories for components
   - Established proper test organization
   - Set up documentation directory
   - Created configuration system

2. **Code Refactoring**
   - Updated import paths
   - Created proper package structure with `__init__.py` files
   - Centralized configuration in `config/settings.py`
   - Created unified entry point in `run.py`

3. **DevOps Updates**
   - Updated Dockerfile for new structure
   - Created multi-service docker-compose.yml
   - Set up data directories for models and logs

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with comprehensive information
   - Preserved existing documentation in appropriate locations
   - Created memory bank for project knowledge

## Active Decisions

1. **Module Organization**
   - Decision to separate code by functionality (API, UI, inference, comparison, utils)
   - Rationale: Improves maintainability and follows separation of concerns

2. **Configuration Approach**
   - Decision to use centralized settings with environment variable overrides
   - Rationale: Balances ease of development with deployment flexibility

3. **Entry Point Design**
   - Decision to create a unified `run.py` with command-line arguments
   - Rationale: Provides flexibility while maintaining simplicity

4. **Docker Strategy**
   - Decision to use multi-service approach in docker-compose
   - Rationale: Allows independent scaling and deployment of components

## Next Steps

1. **Testing Updates**
   - Update test imports to match new structure
   - Ensure all tests pass with new organization

2. **Documentation Completion**
   - Add API documentation
   - Create developer guide for extending the framework

3. **CI/CD Setup**
   - Implement continuous integration workflow
   - Set up automated testing

4. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Implement additional comparison metrics
   - Add visualization improvements
   - Support for additional models

## Current Challenges

1. **Import Path Management**
   - Ensuring all imports work correctly with the new structure
   - Solution: Systematic testing and updates

2. **Configuration Standardization**
   - Moving from hardcoded values to configuration system
   - Solution: Gradual migration with backward compatibility

3. **Docker Optimization**
   - Optimizing container size and build time
   - Solution: Multi-stage builds and careful dependency management

4. **Documentation Consistency**
   - Maintaining consistent documentation across the project
   - Solution: Centralized documentation standards and regular reviews

# LCM Framework Project Brief

## Project Overview
The LCM (Language Model Comparison) Framework is a comprehensive system for comparing and evaluating language models, with a particular focus on Meta's Large Concept Model (LCM-7B) and Llama models. The framework provides tools for side-by-side comparison, performance evaluation, and interactive testing of these models.

## Core Requirements

1. **Model Comparison Capabilities**
   - Compare LCM-7B and Llama-7B models across multiple dimensions
   - Evaluate performance metrics including speed, accuracy, reasoning, and creativity
   - Support for multimodal capabilities assessment

2. **Interactive User Interfaces**
   - Basic chat interface for single-model interaction
   - Enhanced interfaces with visualizations
   - Head-to-head comparison UI for direct model comparison

3. **Robust Backend**
   - FastAPI backend for model inference
   - Efficient session management
   - Health monitoring and metrics collection

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Acceptance tests for validation
   - Stress tests for performance evaluation
   - Predefined test cases for consistent evaluation

5. **Deployment Options**
   - Docker containerization
   - Multi-service architecture
   - Configuration flexibility

## Project Goals

1. Provide a standardized framework for evaluating language model performance
2. Enable direct comparison between LCM and Llama models
3. Support both technical and non-technical users through intuitive interfaces
4. Ensure scalability for future model integration
5. Maintain comprehensive documentation and testing

## Success Criteria

1. Successfully compare models across defined metrics
2. Achieve responsive UI performance (<1s for basic interactions)
3. Support concurrent users in testing scenarios
4. Provide clear, actionable insights from model comparisons
5. Enable easy deployment in various environments

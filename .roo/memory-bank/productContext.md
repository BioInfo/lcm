# LCM Framework Product Context

## Problem Statement
Language models are rapidly evolving, with new architectures and approaches being developed regularly. Organizations and researchers need effective ways to compare different models to understand their relative strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate use cases. Currently, there's a lack of standardized tools for direct comparison between models like Meta's LCM-7B and Llama-7B.

## User Needs

### Technical Users
- Need detailed performance metrics to make informed decisions about model selection
- Require the ability to run custom test cases and scenarios
- Want access to raw data for further analysis
- Need to understand model behavior across different types of tasks

### Non-Technical Users
- Need intuitive interfaces to observe model differences
- Require clear visualizations of performance comparisons
- Want simple explanations of model strengths and weaknesses
- Need to see practical examples of how models handle various queries

## User Experience Goals

1. **Clarity**: Present model comparisons in a clear, understandable format
2. **Efficiency**: Enable quick setup and execution of comparison tests
3. **Flexibility**: Support various comparison scenarios and metrics
4. **Insight**: Provide meaningful analysis beyond raw performance numbers
5. **Accessibility**: Make complex model evaluation accessible to non-technical users

## Key Workflows

### Model Comparison Workflow
1. User selects models to compare
2. User chooses comparison metrics and test cases
3. System runs tests and collects performance data
4. System presents results in visual and textual formats
5. User can drill down into specific aspects of performance

### Interactive Testing Workflow
1. User inputs a prompt or selects from predefined prompts
2. Both models process the prompt simultaneously
3. System displays responses side-by-side with timing information
4. User can rate responses and provide feedback
5. System accumulates feedback for aggregate analysis

## Value Proposition
The LCM Framework provides a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for comparing language models, enabling organizations to make informed decisions about which models best suit their specific needs and use cases. By standardizing the comparison process, it saves time and resources while providing deeper insights into model performance.

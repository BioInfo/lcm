# LCM Framework System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

The LCM Framework follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- **Models**: Inference engines and data structures
- **Views**: UI components (Gradio interfaces)
- **Controllers**: API endpoints and service logic

### 2. Service-Oriented Architecture
- Independent services with defined interfaces
- Communication via RESTful APIs
- Containerization for deployment flexibility

### 3. Factory Pattern
- Used for model initialization and configuration
- Allows dynamic selection of models at runtime
- Supports extension to new model types

### 4. Observer Pattern
- Used for metrics collection and monitoring
- Components publish events to central monitoring
- Enables real-time performance tracking

### 5. Strategy Pattern
- Used for comparison algorithms
- Different metrics can be applied based on context
- Allows for customizable evaluation approaches

## Component Relationships

### Inference Engines
- Encapsulate model loading and execution
- Provide standardized interface for different models
- Handle resource management and optimization

### API Layer
- Provides RESTful endpoints for all functionality
- Manages request validation and error handling
- Coordinates between UI and backend services

### UI Components
- Implement various user interfaces
- Handle user input and result visualization
- Maintain session state for interactive use

### Comparison Services
- Implement algorithms for model comparison
- Process results from multiple models
- Generate comparative metrics and insights

### Utilities
- Provide cross-cutting functionality
- Handle common tasks like text processing
- Support logging and configuration management

## Data Flow

1. User input is captured by UI components
2. Requests are sent to API endpoints
3. API routes requests to appropriate services
4. Models process inputs and generate outputs
5. Comparison services analyze model outputs
6. Results are returned to UI for presentation
7. Metrics are collected throughout the process

## Extension Points

The system is designed for extensibility in several key areas:

1. **New Models**: Additional model types can be integrated by implementing the inference engine interface
2. **New Metrics**: Additional evaluation metrics can be added to the comparison services
3. **New UIs**: Additional user interfaces can be created using the existing API
4. **New Test Cases**: The testing framework can be extended with new test scenarios
